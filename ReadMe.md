# Totem Faucet Server

This server is used to distribute funding for Totem transactions also known as XTX on the Totem Meccano Testnet. 

In order for this to work, this server and the sending server must be configured to accept requests from a known sending server. 

This is achieved through a couple of steps:

1. The sending server must sign the data it sends using a key that can be verified by a ("external") public key known to the recipient (this) server.

2. The sending server must encrypt the data for this server using this server's public encryption key. In other words the sending server must be aware of this server's public encryption key in advance.

### Environmental Variables
In order to configure this server we use environmental variables that can be changed at any time. The variables have the following format and relationship to the sending server.

In this case we are using the Totem chat server to handle fund requests.





## Long Term
The long-term plan is that this development will be enhanced to distribute funds following a payment of cryptocurency by monitoring other blockchains for incoming payments to deterministic public addresses generated by this server.
